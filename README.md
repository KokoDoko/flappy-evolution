# Flappy Evolution

Evolving Flappy Birds until they learn how to fly. 

## Neuro evolution

Flappy bird can teach himself how to fly by neuro-evolution.

- Create a generation of 100 birds with a random brain
- The brain decides when to flap, based on 5 sensory inputs of the bird
- The 2 birds that perform best are selected for the next generation
- Those 2 birds make a child, that child gets slight mutations to create a new generation of 100 birds
- After only a few generations, Flappy can fly all by himself.
- This demo loads the pre-trained brain into 3 birds.
